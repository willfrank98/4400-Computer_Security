The matrix_times_vector() function this time *incorrectly* allocates
memory for y, because it doesn't multiply N by `sizeof(int)`.

The reaosn "h3.c" uses a bigger matrix than "h2.c" is to make it
easier to provoke a crash. Because the allocator might make extra
room, anyway, or because it might not be using memory after the
allocated area, allocating too-little memory is often a difficult bug
to detect by testing alone.


Tool support: Valgrind, again.
